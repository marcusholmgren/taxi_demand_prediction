Machine Learning project that predicts taxi rides in New York City ðŸš•

Marcus is working on a project to predict demand for taxis using time-series analysis and machine learning. His goal is to help taxi companies make more informed decisions about how many taxis to have on the road at any given time, and where to deploy them.

He is using data about past taxi rides, as well as other relevant factors such as weather, events, and traffic conditions, to train a machine learning model. The model will then be used to make predictions about future demand for taxis.

Marcus hopes that his work will help taxi companies to operate more efficiently, and ultimately to provide a better service to their customers.

## Setup

This project uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage the environment. 
You can install miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Install the dependencies from the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate taxi_demand_prediction
```

Deactivate the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```
