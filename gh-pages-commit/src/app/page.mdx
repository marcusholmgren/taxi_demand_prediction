### <SparkleIcon /> Visualize training data

Several new Jupyter notebooks were added to the project. They are steps for gathering, cleaning, and transforming the training and test data.
Lastly, the data is visualized to get a better understanding of what we're working with.

## Commit v0.0.1 {{  date: '2023-09-15T22:05Z' }}

This is my journey through Pau Labarto Bajo's [Real-World ML](https://realworldmachinelearning.carrd.co) tutorial.

This is the initial commit that setup project structure and isolate the Python environment with conda. I'm not sure what this is going to be yet but I'm excited to find out.
