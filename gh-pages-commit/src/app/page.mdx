## Commit v0.0.1 {{  date: '2023-09-15T22:05Z' }}

This is my journey through Pau Labarto Bajo's [Real-World ML](https://realworldmachinelearning.carrd.co) tutorial.

This is the initial commit that setup project structure and isolate the Python environment with conda. I'm not sure what this is going to be yet but I'm excited to find out.
